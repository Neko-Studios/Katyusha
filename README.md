# Katusha: World of Tanks Blitz Discord Bot
### DISCLAIMER: BOT WON'T BE ONLINE MUCH DUE TO MY PC BEING SO OLD; THE CPU OVERHEATS AND SHUTS DOWN TO COOL IT. UNTIL I CAN BUY A RASBERRY PI TO HOST HER, SHE WILL BE IN AND OUT OF BEING OFFLINE AND ONLINE. $25/$60 till target
  
  This is the ***very first*** WoTB Discord bot that does not show user stats.
 You are now wondering "what is the point of a bot that doesn't show stats", well it shows you Warpaint prices, collector, premium tanks, and so much more!
